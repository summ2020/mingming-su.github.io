Hi, my name is Mingming Su. I'm a Ph.D. student in Department of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University, supervised by [Prof. Ning Guo](https://person.zju.edu.cn/nguo). I major in Geotechnical Engineering.

I am majoring in solid mechanics and have rich experience in physical theory, computation, and experiment. I mainly focus on solving Partial Differential Equations of solid mechanics based on the physics-informed neural networks(PINNs), operator learning and deep energy method. My research interest is AI4Science, specifically AI for mechanics.

[A deep complementary energy method for solid mechanics using minimum complementary energy principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01538)

**Yizheng Wang**, Jia Sun, Timon Rabczuk, and Yinghua Liu

[**PDF**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01538.pdf) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
-  We propose the deep complementary energy method (DCEM) based on the principle of minimum complementary energy for the first time.   DCEM outperforms DEM in terms of stress accuracy and efficiency and has an advantage in dealing with complex displacement boundary conditions. A deep complementary energy operator method (DCEM-O) by combining operator learning with physical equations is proposed.
